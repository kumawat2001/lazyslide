📁 Project Links & Resources

This document lists all resources related to the LazySlide project (kumawat2001/lazyslide), along with a brief description of each.

1️⃣ Main GitHub Repository (Notebooks & Code)

Link: 👉 https://github.com/kumawat2001/lazyslide

Description:
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating workflows for whole-slide image analysis using LazySlide — including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, visualization, genomics integration, and more. The notebooks serve as examples showing how to apply LazySlide concepts end-to-end.

Contents:

preprocessing.ipynb – WSI preprocessing

cell_segmentation.ipynb – Segmentation workflows

feature_extraction.ipynb – Extracting features from WSI

visualization.ipynb – Visualizing tiles & features

zero_shot_learning.ipynb – Zero-shot model examples

genomics_integration.ipynb – Integration with genomics

multiple_slides.ipynb – Processing multiple slides

survival_prediction.ipynb – Example survival analysis

requirement.docx – (likely) dependencies or notes

2️⃣ LazySlide Framework (External Resource)

Link: 👉 https://lazyslide.readthedocs.io/

Description:
The LazySlide project is a full Python framework for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis, with APIs for preprocessing, tiling, feature extraction, and more, designed to integrate with the scverse ecosystem. It supports multimodal workflows combining histology and transcriptomics.

Use Case:

Official documentation for installation, tutorials, and API guides

3️⃣ Original LazySlide Upstream Repository (Reference)

Link: 👉 https://github.com/RendeiroLab/LazySlide

Description:
This is the main upstream LazySlide repository. The kumawat2001/lazyslide repo appears to reuse example notebooks from LazySlide, while the upstream repo contains the full implementation, documentation, and development history of the LazySlide framework.

Purpose:
Source code for the LazySlide library

Tutorials, features, models, and CLI tools
